# Development Environment

## C#

These instructions apply if you don't want to use visual studio (note: visual studio is *NOT* visual studio code)

You're going to need [mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/) as well as [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/)

In order to build the project and install the the mod just run:

```
make
```
Make will install the deps and compile the mod. SMAPI will take care of installing it in the right place for us

## The Datadog Agent

The Datadog agent must be installed on your machine and be pointing at the correct org.

 Visit https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent/mac for more instructions.

# Adding packages

I have no clue how to do this nicely outside of visual studio. It's 2:30 am and I'm done trying.
